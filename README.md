# 👋 Hi, I’m Diego Alejandro Ramírez Vargas

Welcome to my GitHub 😀! I’m a passionate AI Developer & Software Engineer with a strong foundation in **data science**, **machine learning**, and **back-end engineering**. I love turning research into production-grade solutions that solve real-world problems.

🎓 I hold a **Master of Artificial Intelligence** (Aug 2023 – Jun 2025) from the University of Technology Sydney and a **Bachelor of Electronics Engineering** (Jan 2016 – Jul 2021) from Pontificia Universidad Javeriana. Along the way, I’ve been honoured with the SAS Postgraduate Data Mining Prize, the UTS AI Showcase People’s Choice Award, and multiple academic excellence scholarships.

### 🚁 GestureFly  

_Associated with University of Technology Sydney_  
- Engineered a drone-navigation platform blending gesture-based commands with facial-identity verification; nominated “People’s Choice” at UTS AI Showcase 2024.  
- Trained a YOLOv9 model to recognize nine distinct hand signals (up, down, left, right, forward, backward, picture, land, take-off).  
- Integrated a Python face-recognition library for live identity checks, ensuring only authorized pilots can operate.  
- Achieved 97.7% accuracy on gesture classification.  
- Built a dataset of ~10,000 labeled images through a capture-and-annotation campaign.  
**Skills:** Python · PyTorch · Computer Vision · OOP · Data Annotation · AI
